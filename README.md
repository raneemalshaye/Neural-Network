# Portuguese Bank Long-term Deposit Predictive Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on addressing a revenue decline in a Portuguese bank caused by insufficient long-term investments by customers. The goal is to identify existing customers who are more likely to subscribe to long-term deposits and to target marketing efforts towards these individuals.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains various customer features that could influence their decision to invest in long-term deposits, such as age, job, education, and other personal attributes.

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Load and preview the data to understand its structure.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize different features to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
4. **Model Building**: Develop a predictive model using a neural network to classify potential customers.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model parameters using Keras Tuner.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
